# Room 3 will start something like this, after the basement door opens
Wonderful! You are much cleverer than I thought. We are now in the prisons of Azkaban and remember this would be the last step which make you out of the chamber. Remember, it's a magical chamber and you cannot leave without find clues and key to escape.
First, you need to make free the prisoner which is locked here in ages. You can only see the prison, only when you call the name of the prisoner.
Let me give you a hint and you will then loudly call the name of the prisoner. He's a prisoner of Azkaban and harry potter's godfather.

--> Sirius Black

Hey, how are you little wizard ! It's me Sirius black. You must help me out of the bars so that I can help you escape the chambers. There is a riddle on side and it's a name of an evil wizard. You must need to think a lot.
and call his name loudly and bars will disappear. Let me give you a hint, the wizard second name is already in the text and it's a horcrux also. What is it?

--> Tom Riddle

Super, I am out of the bars now. But before we escape you need to find a Snapeâ€™s wand which is hidden in the prison. Come with me, I will guide you to find it.
The wand is inside the cupboard, and we need to break it to grab it. Check the walls if you find something.

--> Look the walls
--> I can see an Axe, hanging on the wall.
--> Pickup Axe.
--> Hit Axe on the cupboard.

--> Great now, grab the wand from it and let's run to the chamber's door.
--> Grab/pickup wand.

Awesome, we are now at the door. To unlock the door, you need a spell. Use the wand on the door and cast Alohomora !

--> Use wand on the door

Super, wand is illuminating now. Cast the spell now!

--> Alohomora

Congratulations! You are now out of the chambers. It was not easy, but you made it happen. You can return to Hogwarts now. This is the end of the game....!

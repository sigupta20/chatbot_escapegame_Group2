Remember, you cannot break the walls.\n You need a spell and magical objects which will make the room walls disappear. \n You will find three objects in this room. Once you find all three, start combining them and I will give you a spell to caste that will make the walls around the room disappear into thin air ! \n Start looking room."

  utter_get_out_of_basement:
  - text: "Ah, there you are ! Sure, but solve my three riddles. Each riddle has a meaning which resembles me. \
  \ Combine them and make a meaningful sentence. If you give me the right sentence, I give you the key to run away from basement. \n
  \ Riddle-1:- It can be seen, it can be felt, but it never heard, and never smelt. It comes every day at the end of time, and witches and Dracula love it cause now it's their time. \n
  \ Riddle-2:- It has mighty tall walls, all the riches, and also a dark prison to capture all the evil.\n
  \ Riddle-3:- Possesses magical powers, has never been seen without her magical cloak, and the black cat keeps flying around on broomsticks wearing her hat."

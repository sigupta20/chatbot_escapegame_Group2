  - text: This is a text based adventure game. You're able to pick up items and you're
      also able to combine them in order to solve puzzles. You can try to `look`items, 
      you might be able to `pick up` items and you can try to `use` items on
      other objects. Before you're able to combine items you first need to pick them
      up. If you get stuck, feel free to ask for a hint!
